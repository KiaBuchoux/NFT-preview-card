## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've used flexbox to format most of the design and I feel quite comfortable playing aroung with CSS flex, it is really practical when it comes to centering items on the page. 

On top of that I've learnt to add an overlay on top of an image and using opacity to control the display when hovering over it, I was struggling a little bit but then I googlede and figured out how to use hsl to set opacity instead of rgba so this is something new to me.

### Continued development

It is a fairly easy project but it took me quite a long time to complete it so this is not ideal. But again that's why I'm practising these project :).
